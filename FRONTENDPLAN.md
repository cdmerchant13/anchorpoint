## Current State Analysis

The project has well-defined documentation including:
- A patriotic design system with red/white/blue color scheme
- Clear architecture with React + Vite + Tailwind stack
- Detailed component structure and folder organization
- Content requirements for landing and about pages
- MVP scope focused on search functionality without authentication

## Frontend Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation

1. **Initialize Project Structure**
   - Set up React + Vite project with Tailwind CSS
   - Configure postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js
   - Create folder structure matching ARCHITECTURE.md
   - Set up environment variables for Perplexica API

2. **Implement Design System**
   - Create globals.css with all CSS custom properties from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
   - Set up color palette, typography, and spacing variables
   - Configure Tailwind to use custom properties
   - Create utility classes for consistent styling

### Phase 2: Core Components Development

1. **UI Components** (src/components/ui/)
   - Button.jsx (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary variants)
   - Input.jsx (Search input with proper styling)
   - Card.jsx (For results and content containers)
   - LoadingSpinner.jsx (Loading state indicator)

2. **Layout Components** (src/components/layout/)
   - Header.jsx (Navigation with red accent border)
   - Footer.jsx (Site info with blue accent border)
   - HeroSection.jsx (Landing page hero with CTAs)

### Phase 3: Page Development

1. **Landing Page** (src/App.jsx)
   - Hero section with headline and subheadline
   - Search bar component integration
   - Value propositions section
   - Primary and secondary CTAs
   - Responsive design for all screen sizes

2. **About Page** (src/pages/About.jsx)
   - Information about AnchorPoint's mission
   - Target audience description
   - Value proposition details
   - Contact information placeholder

### Phase 4: Feature Components & Integration

1. **Search Components** (src/components/features/)
   - SearchBar.jsx (Input with submit functionality)
   - ResultsList.jsx (Container for search results)
   - ResultItem.jsx (Individual result display)

2. **Custom Hooks**
   - usePerplexicaQuery.js (API integration hook)
   - API utility functions (src/utils/api.js)

3. **State Management**
   - Implement loading states
   - Error handling and display
   - Search results management

### Phase 5: Polish & Optimization

1. **Accessibility Implementation**
   - Ensure proper color contrast ratios
   - Add focus states for interactive elements
   - Implement semantic HTML structure
   - Add ARIA labels where needed

2. **SEO Optimization**
   - Add meta tags to HTML head
   - Implement proper heading hierarchy
   - Ensure crawlable content

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Optimize layouts for different screen sizes
   - Ensure proper spacing and typography scaling

### Phase 6: Testing & Deployment

1. **Local Testing**
   - Test search functionality with dummy data
   - Verify all components render correctly
   - Test loading and error states
   - Validate accessibility

2. **Build & Deployment**
   - Create production build
   - Configure for static hosting
   - Set up environment-specific configurations

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Critical Path** (MVP Requirements):
   - Landing page with search functionality
   - Basic search results display
   - Loading and error states
   - Responsive design

2. **Secondary Features**:
   - About page
   - Enhanced UI components
   - Accessibility improvements
   - SEO optimization

## Technical Considerations

- **Design System First**: All styling must use the custom properties and guidelines from DESIGN_SYSTEM.md
- **Component Architecture**: Follow the folder structure and naming conventions in ARCHITECTURE.md
- **API Integration**: Use environment variables for Perplexica API configuration
- **Content Requirements**: Implement the specified copy and CTAs from QWEN.md
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all components meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Success Metrics

- Landing page displays correctly with all required elements
- Search bar accepts input and triggers API calls
- Results display in properly styled cards
- All interactive elements have proper focus states
- Design system colors and spacing are consistently applied
- Site is responsive across all device sizes

This plan provides a clear roadmap for developing the frontend while adhering to the established design system and architecture guidelines. The focus is on creating a functional, accessible, and visually consistent MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition of AnchorPoint.
